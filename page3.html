At the outset, Moncler produced quilted sleeping bags, a single model of a lined cagoule and tents with a telescopie structure and outside cover. The first quilted jackets were conceived for protecting workers from the cold. They used the jackets on top of their overalls in the small mountain establishment. The first to note them and realize their potential was the French mountaineer Lionel Terray. The result saw the specialist range "Moncler pour Lionel Terray": quilted jackets, salopettes, gloves, high resistance sleeping bags and extreme protection made them suitable for the harshest climates. All were put to the test in the course of expeditions and were gradually perfected.</p>

Moncler also accompanied the French expedition which reached the summit of Makalù in 1995 and was the official supplier for expeditions in Alaska organised by Lionel Terray in 1964.<p/>

It was a special event that was also to mark the change in logo: Mount Eguit, which rises up behind the village, was replaced by the cockerel. It was the French national downhill skiing team itself that requested a variation on the quilted jacket: it was no longer to be the double version but a single garment that would be more manageable, light and well-suited to competition requirements. Initially called "Huascaran" and then "Nepal", with the addition of leather epaulettes for resting the skis on without damaging the fabric, this more flexible and comfortable version of the jacket was to all intents and purposes the precursor of the present-day Moncler jacket, and heralded its succ<p/></div>

In 2003, Moncler was bought out by the Italian entrepreneur Remo Ruffini, today's President and Creative Director of the company, who was to introduce the strategy of the global quilted jacket.
The IPO of Moncler on the Milan Stock Exchange took place on the 16th December 2013, with an initial value of €10.20 per share</P><img src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSInZ9CyewIcF-nsFfLtQFB0OLg7q1UOmkXA_OmByQi49Bx3kUN"/></div>
